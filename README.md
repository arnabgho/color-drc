## Demo and Pre-trained Models

Please check out the [interactive notebook](demo/demo.ipynb) which shows reconstructions using the learned models. You'll need to - 
- Install a working implementation of torch and itorch.
- Download the pre-trained models for [Pascal3D (490MB)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shubhtuls/cachedir/drc/snapshots/pascalModels.tar.gz) and [ShapeNet (250MB)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shubhtuls/cachedir/drc/snapshots/shapenetModels.tar.gz). Extract the pretrained models to 'cachedir/snapshots/{pascal,shapenet}/'
- Edit the path to the blender executable in the demo script.

## Loss Function Compilation

To use our proposed loss function for training, we need to compile the C implementation so it can be used in Torch.
```
cd drcLoss
luarocks make rpsem-alpha-1.rockspec
```

## Training and Evaluating
For training your own models and evaluating those, or for reproducing the main experiments in the paper, please see the detailed README files for [PASCAL3D](docs/pascal.md) or [ShapeNet](docs/snet.md).

## Additional Dependencies
You'll need to install some additional dependencies (json and matio).
```
sudo apt-get install libmatio2
luarocks install matio
luarocks install json
```
